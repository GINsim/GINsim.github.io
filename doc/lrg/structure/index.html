can be added, edited and removed. The interaction with the graph view is
controled by an editing mode selected through the following buttons available
on the toolbar on the top:</p><p>Available editing modes for regulatory graphs:</p><ul><li><p><img src=/buttons/editmode.gif alt="Edit button"> Default editing mode: allows to select and move objects.</p></li><li><p><img src=/buttons/insertsquare.gif alt="Add Node button"> Component insertion mode: when selected, clicking on the graph panel adds a new component.</p></li><li><p><img src=/buttons/insertpositiveedge.gif alt="Add positive interaction button"> <img src=/buttons/insertnegativeedge.gif alt="Add negative interaction button"> <img src=/buttons/insertdualedge.gif alt="Add dual interaction button"> <img src=/buttons/insertunknownedge.gif alt="Add unknown interaction button"> Interaction insertion mode: when selected, interactions are added by first
selecting one component and dragging the selection to (the same or) another
component. The interactions must be complemented by the definition of the logical
parameters for the target variable (see below). The four buttons allow to add
different types of interactions: activation, inhibition, dual or undefined.</p></li><li><p><img src=/buttons/edit-delete.png alt="Delete button"> Deletion option: selected items (components or interactions) are deleted.</p></li></ul><h1 id=component-order>Component order</h1><p>In GINsim, components are internally ordered. This order has no effect on the regulatory
graph itself, but it has a direct effect on the internal representation of the logical
parameters, with possible effects on (partial) simulation.
The default order follows the node addition chronology, which can be modified
by selecting a (set of) node(s) and using the <code>Up/Down arrows</code> on the left
side of the <code>Modelling Attributes</code> tab.
This change of order will have an effect throughout GINsim, e.g. in the
state transition graph, since the same order is used in the states names.</p><figure><img src=node_order.png><figcaption><h4>Changing component order</h4><p>The left part of the <code>Modelling Attributes</code> tab of a
regulatory graph lists all components of the model and allows to modify their
order. The &ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo; buttons move selected components in the list.</p></figcaption></figure><div class=notices>The selection of several components, can be achieved (like in all lists)
by using the <code>Ctrl</code> key (<code>apple/Cmd</code> key on Mac OS X)
or <code>Shift</code> key, while selecting the nodes.</div><h1 id=component-attributes>Component attributes</h1><p>When a single component is selected, the <code>Modelling Attributes</code>
tab allows to define its properties:</p><ul><li><code>Id</code>: component&rsquo;s identifier. It appears in the graph and it must be unique.</li><li><code>Name</code>: component&rsquo;s long name (optional).</li><li><code>Input</code>: mark a component as an input node, i.e., cannot have regulators.</li><li><code>Max</code>: the maximal expression level of the component.
The default value is 1 (Boolean case).
It can be augmented to generate multi-valued components.</li><li><code>Logical parameters</code>: define the rules controlling the dynamical evolution
of the expression level depending on the active incoming interactions.</li></ul><figure><img src=geneConfig.png><figcaption><h4>Attributes of a component</h4><p>Properties of the gene Cro, as defined in the <strong>lambda4</strong> model.</p></figcaption></figure><div class=notices>The <code>Modelling Attributes</code> tab is divided into three parts.
The combobox selection list (bottom left) permits to select
:doc:<code>annotations</code>, as well as :doc:<code>rules</code> .</div><h1 id=interactions>Interactions</h1><p>When a single interaction arc is selected, the <code>Modelling Attributes</code>
tab allows to define its properties.</p><figure><img src=interactionConfig.png><figcaption><h4>Properties of an interaction arc</h4><p>Properties of the Cro-N interaction in the <strong>lambda4</strong> model.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Depending on a component&rsquo;s activity level, different effects might occur on another
component. These different effects are controled by the definition of different
ranges listed on the left.</p><ul><li><p>The &ldquo;+&rdquo; button creates an additional interaction range.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;-&rdquo; button deletes the selected interaction range.</p></li><li><p>Properties of the selected interaction range can be defined:</p><ul><li><strong>Threshold</strong> defines the lower bound of the selected interaction range.
The interaction becomes <strong>active</strong> when
the activity level of its source component is in this range.</li><li><strong>Sign</strong>: each interaction range can be labelled with activation,
inhibition, dual or unknown.
However, this is only a visual hint, as the real effects of interactions are defined
through :doc:<code>rules</code>.</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id=model-integrity>Model integrity</h1><p>GINsim keeps the definition of regulatory graphs consistent, which means that:</p><ul><li>When an interaction is deleted, all :doc:<code>rules</code> in which it was involved
are also deleted.</li><li>When the <code>max value</code> of a node is decreased, interactions and logical
parameters are checked and, if necessary, updated accordingly and silently
to avoid inconsistencies.</li></ul><p>Since such changes have automatic repercussions on the model parameters
and interaction ranges to keep the model valid, keep in mind that you
need to double-check parameters after performing such changes.</p><p>Checking activation intervals of interactions and the correctness
of logical parameters is left to the user as adding more controls generates more
annoyances than real help. Invalid logical parameters are highlighted to ease their
detection. Keep in mind that a change in the activation-range of one of the
interactions can turn a valid logical parameter into an ill-defined one. Parameters
involving interactions from the same source with disjoint activity ranges
are also ill-defined and thus highlighted for correction.</p></div></section></body></html>
