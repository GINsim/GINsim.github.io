the interactions in a LRG according to the logical rules defined for each node.
These rules, are used to compute the conditions for which a given interaction
has a dual, positive, negative or no effect.</p><h1 id=usage>Usage</h1><p>The <code>Compute interaction functionality</code> entry on the <code>Tools</code> menu opens
the interaction functionality dialog.
This dialog first provides the option to select a perturbation to be applied
to the model before computing the interaction functionality, and it is divided
into three main sections:</p><ul><li>The <strong>perturbation selection</strong>, where the user can select (and define) perturbations.</li><li>The <code>save report</code> button, where the user can export a summary table
of all the conditions of each interaction into a XHTML file, to be visualised
in a browser.</li><li>The <strong>execution options</strong>, where the user can run the computation
and visualise the colors computed by the method or restore the colors
of the original graph.</li></ul><figure><img src=interactionfunctionality.png><figcaption><h4>Example of interaction functionality analysis</h4><p><strong>Left:</strong> The interaction functionality dialog box.
<strong>Right:</strong> The logical regulatory graph, where the sign of
the interactions are highlighted.</p></figcaption></figure><p>After running the tool, the logical regulatory graph interactions will change colour
depending on their function. Their colour code representation will be:
<strong>green</strong>, for interactions having an activatory effect;
<strong>red</strong>, for interactions with an inhibitory effect;
<strong>blue</strong>, for interactions having a dual effect;
and <strong>black</strong>, for non-functional interactions.
Additionally, if the user correctly (incorrectly) defined the sign of the interaction,
this will be represented in normal (increased) thickness.</p><h1 id=report>Report</h1><p>The interaction functionality report is saved to a XHTML file which contains:</p><ul><li>A <strong>summary table</strong>, where for every interaction, it shows the source and
target node, the user defined sign and the computed sign.</li><li>A <strong>detailed table</strong>, where for every interaction, and for all the valuations
of the regulators of the target node, it shows the cases for which the
specific interaction is functional.</li></ul><figure><img src=interactionfunctionality-context.png><figcaption><h4>Example of an functionality context of an interaction</h4><p>For all the valuations of all regulators of target node gB,
the cases for which the interaction gA -> gB is functional are shown.</p></figcaption></figure><h1 id=availability>Availability</h1><p>This feature was implemented in GINsim 3.0.</p></div></section></body></html>
