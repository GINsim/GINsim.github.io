in a graph is a maximal subgraph such that all its components are strongly
connected. Each SCC can either a single node or a set of intertwined cycles
of the original graph.
The SCC graph is a derived graph in which each node represent one of the SCC
of the original graph. This acyclic graph provides a simplified representation
of the organisation of the original graph. This graph is thus often much more compact.</p><p>In GINsim, the graph of the Strongly Connected Components (SCC graph) is often
used to provide a better understanding of the organisation of the attractors in
a <a href=/doc/simulation/transition_graphs>State Transition Graph</a>.
The computation of the SCC graph can be launched through the <code>Construct SCC graph</code>
option of the <code>Tools</code> menu.
Note that GINsim also provides the <a href=/doc/simulation/transition_graphs>Hierarchical Transition Graph</a>
dedicated to this problem.</p><figure><img src=scc.png><figcaption><h4>Strongly Connected Components graph</h4><p>Example of Strongly Connected Component Graph (bottom right) and

The <code>Selection Attribute</code> tab in the bottom panel shows
the content of the selected SCC (i.e. the list of nodes
in the original graph).</p></figcaption></figure><p>Note that while the <code>Construct SCC Graph</code> tool is often applied to
<a href=/doc/simulation/transition_graphs>State Transition Graph</a>, it can
also be applied to Regulatory Graphs (or more formally to any type of graphs).</p><h1 id=extract-from-scc-graph>Extract from SCC graph</h1><p>After computing the SCC graph, another tool enables to recover the subgraph
of the original graph corresponding to the selected nodes in the SCC graph.</p><p>To use it, select some nodes in a SCC graph and run the <code>Extract subgraph</code>
action from the <code>Graph</code> menu.</p><p>This tool will open the original graph, and apply a filter to only keep the
selected parts. To work properly it thus requires that the original graph
had been saved to a file, and that the association between the SCC graph
and the original graph (maintained by GINsim transparently) is still valid.</p></div></section></body></html>
