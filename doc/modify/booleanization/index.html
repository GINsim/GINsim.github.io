have several increasing activity levels. However, some other analysis tools only
consider Boolean (on/off) models.
Model booleanization allows to convert multi-valued models into Boolean models
by mapping each multivalued component on a group of Boolean variables. The
resulting Boolean model generates the same dynamical behaviour as the original
multivalued model.</p><p>bioLQM uses the mapping originaly proposed by van Ham, in which a component
associated with the maximal value <code>m</code> will be mapped on <code>m</code> Boolean components.
For example, a component taking the values <code>0`, </code>1<code>, </code>2<code>, and </code>3<code>will be encoded as</code>000<code>, </code>100<code>, </code>110<code>, and </code>111``.</p><p>The booleanization introduces many non-admissible states, which may require special
care depending on the analysis applied on the booleanized model. This modifier makes
sure that a simulation which start with an admissible state will not explore
non-admissible states. It also prevents the introduction of non-admissible attractors
by making sure that at least one admissible state is reachable from any non-admissible.</p><h1 id=usage>Usage</h1><p>Exporting a multivalued model to a format limited to Boolean components triggers an implicit Booleanization step.
This booleanization step can also be performed explicitely using the booleanization tool in the <code>Actions</code> menu.</p><h1 id=availability-and-further-reading>Availability and further reading</h1><p>This method was implemented in GINsim 3.0.
The backend is implemented in the
<a href=http://colomoto.org/biolqm>bioLQM toolkit</a>,
enabling its programmatic use.</p></div></section></body></html>
