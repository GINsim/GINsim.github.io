perspective, since it is estimated that metastasis accounts for 90% of cancer
patient mortality. Metastasis results from a sequence of multiple steps
including invasion and migration. The early stages of metastasis are tightly
controlled in normal cells and can be drastically affected by malignant
mutations; therefore, they might constitute the principal determinants of the
overall metastatic rate even if the later stages take long to occur. To
elucidate the role of individual mutations or their combinations affecting the
metastatic development, a logical model has been constructed that
recapitulates published experimental results of known gene perturbations on
local invasion and migration processes, and predict the effect of not yet
experimentally assessed mutations. The model has been validated using
experimental data on transcriptome dynamics following TGF-Î²-dependent
induction of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in lung cancer cell lines. A
method to associate gene expression profiles with different stable state
solutions of the logical model has been developed for that purpose. In
addition, we have systematically predicted alleviating (masking) and
synergistic pairwise genetic interactions between the genes composing the
model with respect to the probability of acquiring the metastatic phenotype.
We focused on several unexpected synergistic genetic interactions leading to
theoretically very high metastasis probability. Among them, the synergistic
combination of Notch overexpression and p53 deletion shows one of the
strongest effects, which is in agreement with a recent published experiment in
a mouse model of gut cancer. The mathematical model can recapitulate
experimental mutations in both cell line and mouse models. Furthermore, the
model predicts new gene perturbations that affect the early steps of
metastasis underlying potential intervention points for innovative therapeutic
strategies in oncology.</p><h3>Files</h3><ul><li><a href=SuppMat_Model_Master_Model.zginml>SuppMat_Model_Master_Model.zginml</a></li><li><a href=SuppMat_Model_ModNet.zginml>SuppMat_Model_ModNet.zginml</a></li></ul></div></section></body></html>
