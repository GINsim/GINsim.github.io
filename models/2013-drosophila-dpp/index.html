ligand-induced formation of heterotetrameric complexes consisting of two
type II receptors and two type I receptors with intrinsic serine/threonine
kinase activity. The type I receptor (SAX or TKV) is phosphorylated by the
constitutively active type II receptor kinase (Punt). Consequently, the
complex becomes active and phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smads
(R-Smads). Phosphorylated R-Smads (MAD and Smox) form complexes with a common-
mediator Smad (Medea) and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate
the transcription of target genes in co-operation with other transcription
factors (nejire, schnurri). DPP is a morphogen, i.e. a molecule distributed in
a concentration gradient that elicits different cell fates as a function of
its concentration, thereby organizing a series of cell types in a defined
spatial array. In response to DPP gradient, cells adopt different fates. The
establishment of dpp gradient involves the proteins SOG and TSG. These
proteins together capture the DPP ligand and prevent its binding to the
receptor (Punt). The heteromeric complex (SOG, DPP, TSG) then release the DPP
ligand, a process involving the cleavage of SOG by Tolloid (a
metalloprotease). Other TGF-beta signals, Glass-bottom-boa (GBB) and Screw
(SCW), help DPP to potentiate cells to respond. SCW and GBB are never
expressed together in the same region and affect different cells during: i)
early D/V patterning of the embryo and specification/differentiation of dorsal
cells (if there is no screw, dpp alone is unable to establish the D/V pattern
and embryo lack amnioserosa); ii) the development of adult structures such as
the wing. GBB or SCW form heterodimeric complexes with DPP. These heterodimers
can only signal through TKV, while SCW/SCW and GBB/GBB signals trough SAX, and
DPP/DPP trough TKV and SAX. To model DPP signalling and the formation of the
gradient, we have considered three different levels for the TKV receptor (0,
1, 2) and the MADMED effector (0, 1, 2). The regulatory graph also accounts
for the potentiation of responding cells due to association of DPP and SCW, or
of DPP and GBB. Activated by MADMED, DAD is a pathway inhibitor that can
modulate the pathway activity from high to low signalling. DAD works by
abrogating the phosphorylation of the MADMED complex by TKV or SAX, thus
involving a negative circuit between DAD and the MADMED complex. In addition,
BRK another inhibitor of the DPP pathway can block the transcription of dad.
Our model reproduces the formation of the DPP signalling gradient and accounts
for the role of the heterodimers signalling in cell potentiation. To simulate
DPP signalling, we start from an initial state corresponding to non
differentiated cell, that can receives high or low level of DPP signal. The
use of ternary nodes enables us to account for differential effects of
different DPP levels (gradient). The cells receiving high level expression
display the hetero-dimers SCW/DPP or GBB/DPP and correspond to Tld expression
area, which promotes DPP gradient formation. In presence of medium DPP, TSG
and SOG but no TLD are initially needed to capture homo- or hetero-dimer,
diminishing pathway signalling intensity (expression level 1 for TKV and
MADMED). In presence of high pathway signalling, two situations occur: i) in
cells potentiated by SCW: a sequestering complex (SOG/TSG/ DPP/SCW) will
release the signalling molecule upon TLD clivage, in addition to normal DPP
signalling. This leads to a higher signal transduction. ii) in cells
potentiated by GBB, the situation is similar but involve a different
heterodimer (GBB/DPP). These situations correspond to two different stable
states with high TKV and MADMED (level 2), denoting that more receptors are
required to enable a higher level of nuclear MADMED. We consider five
different initial states: i) the first one corresponds to the absence of
signalling, i.e. absence of DPP; ii) the second one corresponds to medium
signalling, characterized by the presence of Dpp at level 1 and of SCW; iii)
the third one corresponds to medium signalling, characterized by the presence
of Dpp at level 1 and of GBB); iv) the fourth one corresponds to the presence
of DPP at level 2 and of SCW; v) the last one corresponds to the presence of
DPP at level 2 and of GBB. These set of initial states enable the simulation
of five situations. No signalling, two medium and two high signalling that
characterize the behavior of the pathway. The stable state obtained with the
no signalling simulation shows the absence of binding of the ligands to the
receptors TKV and Punt (level of expression 0) and the non activation of
target nodes. These medium signals simulations in presence of DPP, show the
activation of the receptors (level of expression 1) and subsequent signalling
cascade leading to the activation of pathway&rsquo;s targets. These medium signal
are defined by the level of expression 1 for DPP, MADMED and TKV while in the
high signalling sets, these nodes are expressed at level 2. The node Tkv is
multi-valued because the high signalling is characterized by the binding of
hetero dimers (DPP/SCW or DPP/GBB) signalling through TKV. Note that GBB and
SCW don&rsquo;t have the same expression pattern.
