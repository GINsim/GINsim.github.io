division and cell type differentiation, as its cell division cycle generates a
pair of daughter cells that differ from one another in their morphology and
behavior. One of these cells (called stalked) develops a structure that allows
it to attach to solid surfaces and is the only one capable of dividing, while
the other (called swarmer) develops a flagellum that allows it to move in
liquid media and divides only after differentiating into a stalked cell type.
Although many genes, proteins, and other molecules involved in the asymmetric
division exhibited by <em>C. Crescentus</em> have been discovered and characterized
during decades, it remains as a challenging task to understand how cell
properties arise from the high number of interactions between these molecular
components. This chapter describes a modeling approach based on the Boolean
logic framework that provides a means for the integration of knowledge and
study of the emergence of asymmetric division. The text illustrates how the
simulation of simple logic models gives valuable insight into the dynamic
behavior of the regulatory and signaling networks driving the emergence of the
phenotypes exhibited by <em>C. crescentus</em>. These models provide useful tools for
the characterization and analysis of other complex biological networks.</p><h3>Files</h3><ul><li><a href=g2a.zginml>g2a.zginml</a></li><li><a href=g2b.zginml>g2b.zginml</a></li></ul></div></section></body></html>
