responses. These responses are elicited through signalling pathways, which
activate cell cycle checkpoints and basically lead to three cellular fates:
cycle arrest promoting DNA repair, senescence (permanent arrest) or cell
death. Cellular senescence is known for having a tumour-suppressive function
and its regulation arouses a growing scientific interest. Here, we advance a
qualitative model covering DNA damage response pathways, focusing on G1/S
checkpoint enforcement, supposedly more sensitive to arrest than G2/M
checkpoint.</p><h2 id=results>Results</h2><p>We define a discrete, logical model encompassing ATM (ataxia telangiectasia
mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) pathways activation upon DNA damage,
as well as G1/S checkpoint main components. It also includes the stress
responsive protein p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase 14) known to be
involved in the regulation of senescence. The model has four outcomes that
convey alternative cell fates: proliferation, (transient) cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis and senescence. Different levels of DNA damage are considered,
defined by distinct combinations of single and double-strand breaks. Each
leads to a single stable state denoting the cell fate adopted upon this
specific damage. A range of model perturbations corresponding to gene loss-of-
function or gain-of-function is compared to experimental mutations.</p><h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h2><p>As a step towards an integrative model of DNA-damage response pathways to
better cover the onset of senescence, our model focuses on G1/S checkpoint
enforcement. This model qualitatively agrees with most experimental
observations, including experiments involving mutations. Furthermore, it
provides some predictions.</p><h3>Files</h3><ul><li><a href=Senescence_Onset_G1-S.zginml>Senescence_Onset_G1-S.zginml</a></li></ul></div></section></body></html>
