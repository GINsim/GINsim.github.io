the protein Wingless, which is secreted by cells adjacent to the
dorsal–ventral (DV) boundary. Two signaling processes acting between the
second and early third instars and between the mid- and late third instar
control the expression of Wingless in these boundary cells.</p><p>A preliminary model (Apterous-dependent network) was presented in <span class=cite>[1]</span>
,
for the inter-cellular regulatory network activating Notch at the
dorsal–ventral boundary in the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila. This model
focussed on the cross-regulations between five genes (within and between two
cells), which implements the dorsal–ventral border in the developing imaginal
disc.</p><p>This refined model integrates both signaling processes into a multivalued model
encompassing four cells, i.e., a boundary and a flanking cell at each side of
the boundary. Computer simulations of this model enable a qualitative
reproduction of the main wild-type and mutant phenotypes described in the
experimental literature. During the first signaling process, Notch becomes
activated by the first signaling process in an Apterous-dependent manner. In
silico perturbation experiments show that this early activation of Notch is
unstable in the absence of Apterous. However, during the second signaling
process, the Notch pattern becomes consolidated, and thus independent of
Apterous, through activation of the paracrine positive feedback circuit of
Wingless. Consequently, we propose that appropriate delays for Apterous
inactivation and Wingless induction by Notch are crucial to maintain the wild-
type expression at the dorsal–ventral boundary. Finally, another mutant
simulation shows that cut expression might be shifted to late larval stages
because of a potential interference with the early signaling process.</p><dl class=biblio><dt>1</dt><dd><div class=ref><div class=type></div><a href><span class=title>GINsim: a software suite for the qualitative modelling, simulation and analysis of regulatory networks..</span></a>
