GINsim is a software tool implementing the **multilevel logical formalism**.
It leans on two main types of graphs:
[Logical Regulatory Graphs]({{< relref "lrg/_index.md" >}}),
which model regulatory networks, and
[transition graphs]({{< relref "simulation/transition_graphs.md" >}}),
which represent their dynamical behaviour.
