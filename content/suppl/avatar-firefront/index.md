summary: Estimating attractor reachability in asynchronous logical models
aliases:

FIREFRONT & AVATAR are two methods to identify reachable attractors and quantify their likelihoods,
i.e. to determine their reachability probabilities (from specific initial conditions or over the 
whole state space), considering asynchronous dynamics.

Benchmark models are provided here to permit reproducing results presented in the main text (Table 1)
and supplementary material (Table S1). Model files are provided in GINML format, to be open with GINsim.
