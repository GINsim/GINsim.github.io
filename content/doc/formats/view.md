The graph view can be exported as an image in the PNG format.
This export considers only the visual appareance of the graph,
and can thus be applied to all types of graph in GINsim.

The view can also be exported in the 
[Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) format.
Tools like [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org), can then be used to display,
modify and export SVG files to virtually any image format.
