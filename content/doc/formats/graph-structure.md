The following exports consider only the graph structure, and
can thus be applied to all types of graph in GINsim.

The graph structure can be exported for use in dedicated graph visualization software,
which can handle some graphs considered as too large for viewing in GINsim directly.
These exports only consider the graph structure (graphical attributes are lost).
The following formats are supported:

# Graphviz

Files in the [DOT language](http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language)
can be opened using the graph visualization software
[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org).


# BioLayout

[Biolayout](http://www.biolayout.org), is a graph visualization software focussing
on biological networks.

# Cytoscape

Cytoscape (see <link href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">www.cytoscape.org</link>),
is also used for the analysis of biological networks. While GINsim can export 
regulatory graphs for cytoscape, this format is not yet available for other types of graphs.
