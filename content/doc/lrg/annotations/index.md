Annotations can be attached to the different components of the regulatory graph:

* the graph itself,
* components,
* interactions.

An annotation is composed of a textual comment and a numbered list of URIs,
which can be opened using the ``[i]`` buttons on the left side.

The same **Annotation panel** is used for all elements
supporting notes. This screenshot shows the graph annotations,
available when the selection is empty.



Some shortcuts are provided for linking to entries in online databases.
For exemple, ``pubmed:19426782`` will open http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19426782.
This relies on the [identifiers.org webservice](http://identifiers.org).
