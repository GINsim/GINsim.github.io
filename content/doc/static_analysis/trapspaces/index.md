summary: Identify stable motifs containing complex attractors
---

This tool allows the analytic (i.e. without running a simulation) determination of
trapspaces of the model. These trapspaces contain the stable states, as well as an
approximation for complex attractors {{<cite Klarner2014 >}}.


Usage
=====

This tool is available from the ``Trapspace`` option of the ``Tools`` menu.

Availability
============

Trapspace identification was first implemented in GINsim 3.0, relying on 
the [bioLQM toolkit](http://www.colomoto.org/biolqm).
