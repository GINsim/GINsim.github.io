This logical model encompasses 48 components and 82 regulatory interactions
controlling mesoderm specification during Drosophila development, thereby
integrating all major genetic processes underlying the formation of four
mesodermal tissues. The model is based on in vivo genetic data, partly
confirmed by functional genomic data.



Model simulations qualitatively recapitulate the expression of the main
lineage markers of each mesodermal derivative, from developmental stage 8 to
10, for the wild type case, as well as for over twenty reported mutant
genotypes.



This model has been used to systematically predict the effects of over 300
loss- and gain-off unction mutations, and combinations thereof. By generating
specific mutant combinations, several novel predictions experimentally could
be validated, demonstrating the robustness of model.
