IL-17A and F are critical cytokines in anti-microbial immunity but also contribute to auto-immune pathologies.
Recent evidence suggests that they may be differentially produced by T-helper (Th) cells but the underlying 
mechanisms remain unknown. To address this question, a logical model containing 82 components and 136 regulatory 
links was developed and calibrated with original flow cytometry data using naive CD4+ T cells in conditions inducing 
either IL-17A or F. Model analyses led to the identification of the transcription factors NFAT2A, STAT5A and Smad2 
as key components explaining the differential expression of IL-17A and IL-17F, with STAT5A controlling IL-17F 
expression, and an interplay of NFAT2A, STAT5A and Smad2 controlling IL-17A expression.
