This model provides a generic high-level view of the interplays between NFÎºB
pro-survival pathway, RIP1-dependent necrosis, and the apoptosis pathway in
response to death receptor-mediated signals.


Wild type simulations demonstrate robust segregation of cellular responses to
receptor engagement. Model simulations recapitulate documented phenotypes of
protein knockdowns and enable the prediction of the effects of novel
knockdowns. In silico experiments simulate the outcomes following ligand
removal at different stages, and suggest experimental approaches to further
validate and specialise the model for particular cell types.


This analysis gives specific predictions regarding cross-talks between the
three pathways, as well as the transient role of RIP1 protein in necrosis, and
confirms the phenotypes of novel perturbations. Our wild type and mutant
simulations provide novel insights to restore apoptosis in defective cells.
The model analysis expands our understanding of how cell fate decision is
made.


The original model focuses on the interplay between three pathways activated
in response to the same signal.


This model has then been adapted for multiscale analysis {{<cite "models/226" />}}.
