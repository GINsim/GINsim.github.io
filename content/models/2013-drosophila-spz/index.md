During DV patterning, a regulatory cascades composed by three dorsal group
genes gastrulation-defective, snake and easter, encoding serine proteases,
lead to the cleavage of Spatzle (SPZ), that in turn activates the Toll-dorsal
signaling pathway {{<cite "models/116" "models/117">}}. Spatzle presumably forms
a gradient in the perivitelline fluid. Toll signaling is ultimately responsible
for the formation of the embryonic dorsal nuclear gradient. In the nucleus, dorsal
controls the expression of zygotic genes in a concentration-dependent manner
and this process results in the patterning of the dorsalâ€“ventral embryonic
axis. twist is one of the earliest target genes controlled by the highest
concentration of dorsal in the mesodermal cells. It is a transcriptional
activator that cooperates with dorsal in activating snail in the mesoderm.
Dorsal and Twist also cooperate to activate the neurogenic gene, sim (single
minded), expressed in the neurectoderm and repressed by Snail in the mesoderm.
Natural or experimentally induced infections by fungi or bacteria elicit a
specific response in both adult flies and larvae. The proteoglycans of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria are sensed by distinct pattern recognition proteins
called PGRPs (peptidoglycan recognition proteins {{<cite "models/118">}}.
Different PRGPs cooperate to activate the Toll pathway. The activation of PGRP-SA
by Gram- positive bacteria leads to Spatzle cleavage {{<cite "models/119">}}.
Fungal infection also leads to the cleavage of Spatzle, but the proteolytic
cascade in this case involves the circulating serine protease Persephone and its
serine protease inhibitor, Necrotic {{<cite "models/120" "models/122" "models/125">}}.
Circulating PGRP-SA receptor activates the Toll pathway upon detection of Lysine-type
PGN which is a major component of the cell wall of many Gram-positive bacterial strains.
GNBP1 (Gram-Negative Binding Protein 1) associates with PGRP-SA and this complex
activates a downstream proteolytic cascade that leads to the cleavage of Spatzle,
which then activates the Toll transmembrane receptor. In addition, four other
serine proteases, namely Spirit, Spheroide, and Sphinx1 and 2, were identified
in response to both fungi and Gram-positive bacteria infections. Thus, PGRP-SA
and GNBP1 define a Gram-positive-specific branch of Toll receptor activation.
PGRP-SD also belongs to this branch and is required for the detection of other
Gram-positive and negative bacterial strains. In short, the maturation of SPZ
activates Toll in both early embryo and immune response and is controlled by
different sets of proteases {{<cite "models/123" "models/124">}}. To reproduce
biological data during SPZ processing, we define four initial states corresponding
the biological process involved. All these initial state lead to the formation of
the active form of SPZ.
