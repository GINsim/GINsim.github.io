Lineage fate decisions of hematopoietic cells depend on intrinsic factors and
extrinsic signals provided by the bone marrow microenvironment, where they
reside. Abnormalities in composition and function of hematopoietic niches have
been proposed as key contributors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL)
progression. Our previous experimental findings strongly suggest that pro-
inflammatory cues contribute to mesenchymal niche abnormalities that result in
maintenance of ALL precursor cells at the expense of normal hematopoiesis.
Here, we propose a molecular regulatory network interconnecting the major
communication pathways between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)
and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within the bone marrow. Dynamical
analysis of the network as a Boolean model reveals two stationary states that
can be interpreted as the intercellular contact status.
Furthermore, simulations describe the molecular patterns observed during
experimental proliferation and activation. Importantly, our model predicts
instability in the CXCR4/CXCL12 and VLA4/VCAM1 interactions following
microenvironmental perturbation due by temporal signaling from Toll like
receptors (TLRs) ligation. Therefore, aberrant expression of NF-ÎºB induced by
intrinsic or extrinsic factors may contribute to create a tumor
microenvironment where a negative feedback loop inhibiting CXCR4/CXCL12 and
VLA4/VCAM1 cellular communication axes allows for the maintenance of malignant
cells.
