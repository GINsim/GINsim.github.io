In breast cancer, overexpression of the transmembrane tyrosine kinase ERBB2 is
an adverse prognostic marker, and occurs in almost 30% of the patients. For
therapeutic intervention, ERBB2 is targeted by monoclonal antibody
_trastuzumab_ in adjuvant settings; however, de novo resistance to this
antibody is still a serious issue, requiring the identification of additional
targets to overcome resistance. In this study, we have combined computational
simulations, experimental testing of simulation results, and finally reverse
engineering of a protein interaction network to define potential therapeutic
strategies for de novo _trastuzumab_ resistant breast cancer.



First, we employed Boolean logic to model regulatory interactions and
simulated single and multiple protein loss-of-functions. Then, our simulation
results were tested experimentally by producing single and double knockdowns
of the network components and measuring their effects on G1/S transition
during cell cycle progression. Combinatorial targeting of ERBB2 and EGFR did
not affect the response to _trastuzumab_ in _de novo_ resistant cells, which
might be due to decoupling of receptor activation and cell cycle progression.
Furthermore, examination of c-MYC in resistant as well as in sensitive cell
lines, using a specific chemical inhibitor of c-MYC (alone or in combination
with _trastuzumab_ ), demonstrated that both _trastuzumab_ sensitive and
resistant cells responded to c-MYC perturbation.



In this study, we connected ERBB signaling with G1/S transition of the cell
cycle via two major cell signaling pathways and two key transcription factors,
to model an interaction network that allows for the identification of novel
targets in the treatment of _trastuzumab_ resistant breast cancer. Applying
this new strategy, we found that, in contrast to _trastuzumab_ sensitive
breast cancer cells, combinatorial targeting of ERBB receptors or of key
signaling intermediates does not have potential for treatment of de novo
_trastuzumab_ resistant cells. Instead, c-MYC was identified as a novel
potential target protein in breast cancer cells.
