This manuscript focuses on the formal analysis of the gap-gene network
involved in Drosophila segmentation. The gap genes are expressed in defined
domains along the anteriorâ€“posterior axis of the embryo, as a response to
asymmetric maternal information in the oocyte. Though many of the individual
interactions among maternal and gap genes are reasonably well understood, we
still lack a thorough understanding of the dynamic behavior of the system as a
whole. Based on a generalized logical formalization, the present analysis
leads to the delineation of:

1. The minimal number of distinct, qualitative, functional levels associated 
   with each of the key regulatory factors (the three maternal Bcd, Hb and
   Cad products, and the four gap Gt, Hb, Kr and Kni products).
2. The most crucial interactions and regulatory circuits of the earliest
   stages of the segmentation process.
3. The ordering of different regulatory interactions governed by each of these
   products according to corresponding concentration scales.
4. The role of gap-gene cross-interactions in the transformation of graded
   maternal information into discrete gap-gene expression domains. The proposed
   model allows not only the qualitative reproduction of the patterns of gene
   expression characterized experimentally, but also the simulation and prediction
   of single and multiple mutant phenotypes.
