- Boolean model resulting from the merging of the two Boolean models for TCR and TLR5 signalling as listed above. This comprehensive Boolean model encompasses 128 nodes, including three externally controlled inputs (TLR5, TCR, and CD28 ) and six phenotypic nodes

CD4+ T cells recognize antigens through their T cell receptors TCR). However,
additional signals involving co-stimulatory receptors, for example CD28, are
required for proper T cell activation. Alternative co-stimulatory receptors
have been proposed, including members of the Toll-like receptor family, such
as TLR5 and TLR2.



We report here three Boolean models for:

* the T cell receptor (TCR) signalling pathway;
* the Toll-like receptor (TLR5) signalling pathway;
* the combination of TCR and TLR5 pathway, taking into accounting cross-interactions.



These models were validated by analysing the responses of T cells to the
activation of these pathways alone or in combination, in terms of CREB, c-Jun
and p65 activation.
The resulting merged model accurately reproduces the experimental results,
showing that the activation of TLR5 can play a similar role to that of CD28,
regarding AP-1, CREB and NF-ÐºB activation, thereby, providing insights
regarding the cross-regulation of these pathways in CD4+ T cells.
