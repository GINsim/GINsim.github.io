In Drosophila, three secreted ligands (OS, UPD2 and UPD3) have been identified
for the JAK/STAT pathway. Their binding to the receptor dome induces its homo-
dimerization, enabling hop to phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues of the
receptor. Consequently, STAT92E is also phosphorylated by HOP, leading to his
homo-dimerization and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, STAT92E binds to
target DNA sequences and acts as an activator of transcription of several
target genes {{<cite "models/103" />}}. During Drosophila development, the JAK/STAT
pathway is involved in embryonic segmentation, eye development, cell growth,
haematopoiesis, and sex determination {{<cite "models/104" "models/105" />}}.
JAK/STAT signalling also plays important roles during spermatogenesis
{{<cite "models/106" />}} and oogenesis
{{<cite "models/105" "models/107" "models/108" />}}. To study the
dynamic of the pathway, we define a set of initial states
representative of in vivo situations during JAK/STAT signalling. More
precisely, we define a three initial states corresponding to pathway
signalling (binding of OS or UPD2 or UPD3) and two initial states
corresponding to pathway signalling in the presence of an inhibitor (SOCS44A
or BRWD3) and one initial state corresponding to non signalling conditions (no
binding of ligands).
