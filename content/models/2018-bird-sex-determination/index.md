This logical model assembles the current knowledge on the regulation of
primary sex determination in chicken. Relying on experimental data, a gene
network was constructed, leading to a logical model that integrates both the
Z-dosage and dominant W hypotheses. The model showed that the sexual fate of
chicken gonads results from the resolution of the mutual inhibition between
DMRT1 and FOXL2; the initial amount of DMRT1 product determines the
development of the gonads. In this respect, the W-factor functions at the
initiation step as a second device, by reducing the amount of DMRT1 in ZW
gonads when the sexual fate of the gonad is settled; i.e. when SOX9 functional
state is determined. Developmental constraints that are instrumental in this
resolution were identified. These constraints correspond to qualitative
restrictions regarding the relative transcription rates of the genes DMRT1,
FOXL2 and HEMGN. The model further clarified the role of oestrogen in
maintaining FOXL2 function during ovary development.
