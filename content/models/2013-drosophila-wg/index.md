In the absence of WG, the protein complex composed by Axin, Shaggy (SGG or
ZW3) and APC sequesters and ubiquitinilates Armadillo, leading to a Slmb-
dependant degradation by the proteasome. In the absence of ARM, PAN binds to
GRO to repress WG targets. Binding of Wingless to Arrow (ARR) or Frizzled (FZ)
triggers a set of reactions, starting with the activation of Dishevelled,
which in turn inhibits the AXN-SGG-APC complex. This leads (with the help of
HIPK) to the accumulation and the stabilisation of ARM. Next, ARM translocates
into the nucleus and binds Pangolin (PAN). Then, the ARM/PAN complex with the
help of other cofactors (LGS, Nej, Pygo and Hyx) activates the transcription
of WG targets. During some patterning processes as in wing disc, Nemo can
inhibit PAN and thereby controls the level of WG signalling. To study
dynamically the WG signalling pathway, we define two initial states
corresponding to the binding of WG ligand and to the absence of binding
condition. From these two initial states, we compute the resulting stable
states recapitulating the activation or the non activation of the pathway,
respectively.
