# Background

Primary sex determination in placental mammals is a very well studied
developmental process. Here, we aim to investigate the currently established
scenario and to assess its adequacy to fully recover the observed phenotypes,
in the wild type and perturbed situations. Computational modelling allows
clarifying network dynamics, elucidating crucial temporal constrains as well
as interplay between core regulatory modules.


# Results

Relying on a comprehensive revision of the literature, we define a logical
model that integrates the current knowledge of the regulatory network
controlling this developmental process. Our analysis indicates the necessity
for some genes to operate at distinct functional thresholds and for specific
developmental conditions to ensure the reproducibility of the sexual pathways
followed by bi-potential gonads developing into either testes or ovaries. Our
model thus allows studying the dynamics of wild type and mutant XX and XY
gonads. Furthermore, the model analysis reveals that the gonad sexual fate
results from the operation of two sub-networks associated respectively with an
initiation and a maintenance phases. At the core of the process is the
resolution of two connected feedback loops: the mutual inhibition of Sox9 and
ÃŸ-catenin at the initiation phase, which in turn affects the mutual inhibition
between Dmrt1 and Foxl2, at the maintenance phase. Three developmental signals
related to the temporal activity of those sub-networks are required: a signal
that determines Sry activation, marking the beginning of the initiation phase,
and two further signals that define the transition from the initiation to the
maintenance phases, by inhibiting the Wnt4 signalling pathway on the one hand,
and by activating Foxl2 on the other hand.


# Conclusions

Our model reproduces a wide range of experimental data reported for the
development of wild type and mutant gonads. It also provides a formal support
to crucial aspects of the gonad sexual development and predicts gonadal
phenotypes for mutations not tested yet.
