Altered molecular responses to insulin and growth factors (GF) are responsible
for late-life shortening diseases such as type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
cancers. We have built a network of the signaling pathways that control
S-phase entry and a specific type of senescence called geroconversion. We have
translated this network into a Boolean model to study possible cell phenotype
outcomes under diverse molecular signaling conditions. In the context of
insulin resistance, the model was able to reproduce the variations of the
senescence level observed in tissues related to T2DM's main morbidity and
mortality. Furthermore, by calibrating the pharmacodynamics of mTOR
inhibitors, we have been able to reproduce the dose-dependent effect of
rapamycin on liver degeneration and lifespan expansion in wild-type and
HER2–neu mice. Using the model, we have finally performed an in silico
prospective screen of the risk–benefit ratio of rapamycin dosage for healthy
lifespan expansion strategies. We present here a comprehensive prognostic and
predictive systems biology tool for human aging.
