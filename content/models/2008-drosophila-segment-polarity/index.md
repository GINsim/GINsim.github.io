Initially activated by the pair-rule genes, the expression patterns of the
segment polarity genes engrailed and wingless become consolidated through
inter-cellular interactions between juxtaposed cells. Here, we delineate a
logical model focusing on a dozen molecular components at the core of the
regulatory network controlling this process. Our model analysis leads to the
following conclusions:

1. the pair-rule signals, which activate engrailed and wingless genes independently
   of each other, need to be operative until the inter-cellular circuit involving
   these two genes is functional. This implies that the pair-rule pattern is
   instrumental both in determining the activation of the genes engrailed and
   wingless in rows of adjacent cells, and in consolidating these expression patterns.
1. The consolidation of engrailed and wingless expression patterns requires the proper
   activation of both autocrine and paracrine Wingless-pathways, as well as the full
   activation of the Hedgehog pathway.
3. Protein kinase A plays at least two roles through the phosphorylation of Cubitus
   interruptus, the effector molecule of the Hedgehog signalling pathway.
4. The roles of Sloppy-paired and Naked in the delineation of the engrailed and
   wingless expression domains are emphasized as being important for segmental
   boundary formation. Moreover, the application of an original computational method
   leads to the delineation of a subset of crucial regulatory circuits enabling the
   coexistence of specific expression states at the cellular level, as well as specific
   combination of cellular states inter-connected through Wingless and Hedgehog signalling.

Finally, the simulation of altered expressions of segment polarity genes leads to results
consistent with the published data concerning loss-of-function mutants and
ectopic gene expressions. Moreover, this model makes predictions about genetic
interactions that can be tested by further experiments.
