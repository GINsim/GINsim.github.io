The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly
interconnected signalling pathways involved in the control of diverse cellular
processes, including cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation.
Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built
a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling
network, using CellDesigner software.



In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better
understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the
most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical
model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis
particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network
deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes.



To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have
applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state
transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of
systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network
perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico
experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components,
cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative
proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with
established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3
(FGFR3) activating mutations.
