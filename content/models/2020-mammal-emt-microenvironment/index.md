Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) has been associated with cancer
cell heterogeneity, plasticity and metastasis. However, the extrinsic signals
supervising these phenotypic transitions remain elusive. To identify
microenvironmental signals controlling cancer-associated phenotypes amid the
EMT continuum, we defined a logical model of the EMT cellular network that
access the qualitative degrees of cell adhesions by adherent junctions and
focal adhesions, two features affected during EMT.

Model attractors could recover epithelial, mesenchymal and hybrid phenotypes.
In silico simulations provided evidences that hybrid phenotypes may arise through 
independent molecular paths, involving stringent extrinsic signals. Of particular
interest, model predictions and their experimental validations indicated that:
1) ECM stiffening is a prerequisite for cells overactivating FAK-SRC to
upregulate SNAIL1 and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype.
2) FAK-SRC inhibition of cell-cell contacts through the Receptor Protein Tyrosine
Phosphates kappa leads to the acquisition of a full mesenchymal rather than a
hybrid phenotype.

Altogether, our computational and experimental approaches permitted to identify 
critical microenvironmental signals controlling hybrid EMT phenotypes, and 
indicated that EMT involves multiple molecular programs.
