This model is a direct transcription of the Boolean model published by Irons
{{<cite "models/34">}}, except for the specific temporisation system.
Synchronous simulation of this model recovers the results obtained by Irons
in absence of time delays (Fig. 3B in {{<cite "models/34">}} ), i.e. a single
cyclic attractor qualitatively consistent with available kinetic data.
