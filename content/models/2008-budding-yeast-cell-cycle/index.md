This model is a direct transcription of the Boolean model published by Orlando
et al. {{<cite "models/32" >}}. Synchronous simulation of this model yields a
cyclic attractor gathering most trajectories in the state transition graph,
which is robust to parameter choice. However, asynchronous simulations all
lead to a stable state with all variables OFF, whatever the parameter set
proposed by the authors, indicating that the oscillations observed in the
synchronous simulations may not be sustained.
