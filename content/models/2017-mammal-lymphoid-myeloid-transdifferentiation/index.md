Blood cells are derived from a common set of hematopoietic stem cells, which
differentiate into more specific progenitors of the myeloid and lymphoid
lineages, ultimately leading to differentiated cells. This developmental
process is controlled by a complex regulatory network involving cytokines and
their receptors, transcription factors and chromatin remodelers.
Based on public and novel data from molecular genetic experiments (qPCR,
western blots, EMSA), along with genome-wide assays (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq), we
defined a logical model recapitulating cytokine-induced differentiation of
common progenitors, the effect of various reported gene knock-downs, as well
as reprogramming of pre-B cells into macrophages induced by ectopic expression
of specific transcription factors.
