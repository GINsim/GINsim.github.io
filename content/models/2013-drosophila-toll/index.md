Toll was initially discovered as an essential component of the pathway that
establishes the dorsal, ventral axis of the early Drosophila embryo. If any
component in that genetic pathway is missing, no ventral or lateral cell types
develop and the resulting embryos lack all mesoderm and the entire nervous
system {{<cite "models/149" >}}. Fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections
in Drosophila also stimulate the Toll pathway. Activation of Toll leads to
recruitment of three cytoplasmic proteins, which are MYD88, Tube and Pelle, to
form the signalling complex underneath the cell membrane {{<cite "models/150" >}}.
Subsequently, through interactions via death domains, assembly of the signalling
complex containing MYD88, Tube and Pelle occurs {{<cite "models/150" "models/151" >}}.
From this complex, signalling proceeds through the phosphorylation and degradation
of the Drosophila IkB factor Cactus. In non signaling conditions, Cactus is bound
to Dorsal or Dorsal-related immunity factor (DIF), inhibiting their activity and
nuclear localization. Pelle is the only kinase reported for Cactus phosphorylation.
After phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of Dorsal/DIF leads to activation of
transcription of several sets of target genes {{<cite "models/151" "models/124" >}}.
To reproduce pathway signalling dynamics, we define two initial states corresponding
to no signalling conditions (no ligand binding) and to signalling conditions 
(binding of SPZ to the receptor Toll).
