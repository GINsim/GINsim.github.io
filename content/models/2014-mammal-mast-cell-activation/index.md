Based on an exhaustive curation of the existing literature and using the
software CellDesigner, we have built and annotated a comprehensive molecular
map for the FceRI and FcgRIIb signalling pathways, which play a key role in
mast cell activation in mammals. Using this map and the logical modelling
software GINsim, we have derived a logical model recapitulating the most
salient features of mast cell activation. This model can be used to explore
the dynamical properties of the system and its responses to different stimuli,
in normal or mutant conditions.
