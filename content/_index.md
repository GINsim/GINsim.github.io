GINsim (Gene Interaction Network simulation) is a software tool
for the design and analysis of qualitative dynamical models of
genetic regulatory networks.



Recent developments in functional genomics have generated large 
amounts of data on gene expression and on the underlying regulatory
mechanisms. This has resulted in the progressive mapping of complex
regulatory networks. As these networks usually include numerous
intertwined feedback circuits, gaining an understanding of their
spatio-temporal behaviour defies the intuition.
Formal modelling approaches become a necessary complement to
experimental tools. As precise information on molecular mechanisms
and the value of kinetic parameters are currently difficult to establish,
qualitative methods offer a highly attractive approach to model and
analyse essential properties of genetic regulatory networks.



# Logical modelling formalism

GINsim consists of a simulator of qualitative models of genetic 
regulatory networks based on a discrete, logical formalism.

GINsim allows the user to specify a model of a genetic regulatory
network in term of asynchronous, multivalued logical functions,
and to simulate and/or analyse its qualitative dynamical behaviour.
