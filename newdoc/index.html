This has resulted in the progressive mapping of complex regulatory networks. As these networks usually include numerous intertwined feedback circuits, gaining an understanding of their spatio-temporal behaviour defies the intuition of the biologists. In this respect, formal modelling and simulation tools become a necessary complement to experimental tools. As precise information on molecular mechanisms and the value of kinetic parameters are currently difficult to establish, qualitative methods offer a highly attractive approach to model and analyse essential properties of genetic regulatory networks.
General information on modelling and analysis of genetic regulatory networks can be found in {{ }}.</p><p>GINsim consists of a simulator of qualitative models of genetic regulatory networks based on a discrete, logical formalism.</p><p>GINsim allows the user to specify a model of a genetic regulatory network in term of asynchronous, multivalued logical functions, and to simulate and/or analyse its qualitative dynamical behaviour {{ }}.</p><p>{{ &lt;readFile &ldquo;quickstart.md&rdquo;> }}</p></div></section><section class=children><div class=content><div class=relative><a href=https://ginsim.github.io/newdoc/quickstart/><div class=summary><h1></h1><div class=text>Install and Run GINsim Availability and Requirements GINsim 3.0 is freely available without guarantees.
